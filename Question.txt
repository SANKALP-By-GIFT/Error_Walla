🧪 SDP Open Book Examination
Project Option: Admin Dashboard with Analytics (Frontend Only)

Duration: 5 Hours (Development)
Evaluation: 2:00 – 4:00 PM (Demo + GitHub Review)
Difficulty Level: Medium → Moderate Advanced (MCA Level)
Backend: ❌ Not Allowed (Use Mock APIs Only)

📌 Problem Statement

You are required to design and implement a Single Page Admin Dashboard Application using React.

The dashboard must simulate:

Authentication & protected routing

Sidebar-based navigation

Analytics data display

Server-state fetching using React Query

Performance optimization techniques

The objective is to evaluate your understanding of:

Routing architecture

Server state management

Component composition

Performance optimization

Clean folder structure

🎯 SECTION A — CORE REQUIREMENTS
1️⃣ Authentication & Protected Routes 
Functional Requirements

Implement a Login page

Simulate authentication (mock token)

Redirect authenticated users to dashboard

Prevent unauthenticated users from accessing dashboard routes

Implement Logout functionality

Technical Requirements

Use React Router v6

Create ProtectedRoute component

Store authentication state using Context API

Token simulation (string-based)

2️⃣ Sidebar Navigation Layout
UI Requirements

Create a fixed sidebar layout with the following routes:

/dashboard
/dashboard/analytics
/dashboard/users
/dashboard/settings


Sidebar must include:

Logo/title

Navigation links

Active link highlighting

Logout button

Technical Requirements

Nested routing structure

Layout component wrapping dashboard routes

Use Outlet for nested rendering

3️⃣ Analytics Dashboard Page
Functional Requirements

Display:

Total Users

Total Revenue

Active Subscriptions

Monthly Growth %

Each metric must be displayed using a reusable StatCard component.

Technical Requirements

Fetch analytics data using React Query

Endpoint example:

GET /analytics


Handle:

Loading state

Error state

Empty state

Data must be displayed dynamically

4️⃣ Users Management Page
Functional Requirements

Display list of users

Each row shows:

Name

Email

Status (Active/Inactive)

Technical Requirements

Fetch data using React Query

Endpoint:

GET /users


Render list in table format

Use reusable table row component

5️⃣ Reusable Components Architecture

You must create reusable components for:

StatCard

SidebarLink

PageHeader

Loader

ErrorMessage

Explain in comments:

Why reusability improves maintainability

6 - You must:

Use React.lazy

Wrap routes inside Suspense

Lazy load:

Analytics page

Users page

Settings page

Explain in comments:

How code splitting improves performance

Optimize sidebar rendering

Explain:

What problem memoization solves
